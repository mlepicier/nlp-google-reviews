# Natural Language Processing on Google Reviews

## Abstract:

<p align="justify">This project consists of web-scrapping, cleaning, and preparing text data following the common <b>Natural Language Processing</b> (NLP) techniques to apply simple machine learning models in order to leverage predictive analytics to conduct sentiment analysis and classify Google reviews as either Bad (1, 2, and 3 stars) or Good (4 and 5 stars). This project was conducted from January 2022 to April 2022 as a student at <b>Ivey Business School</b>. Below are a few paragraphs to give you context about the project.</p> 

## Repository Assets:

- [Natural Language Processing Models](nlp/) - [Full Code](nlp/nlp_models.ipynb)
- [Web-Scrapping Automation](web-scrapping/) - [Full Code](web-scrapping/web-scrapping_reviews.ipynb)
- [Web-Scrapped Datasets](data/)

## Business Context:

<p align="justify"><b>Google</b> is frequently used for hunting restaurants. The customers will look for reviews and ratings to pick their eating location. People will write about positive words like "<i>good taste</i>", "<i>perfect service</i>", and "<i>nice vibe</i>" and give higher star scores when they enjoy the place. In contrast, when people have bad experiences, they will also provide negative feedback with lower scores. However, the Google rating trend is not always clear and straightforward. When the customers do not have extreme feelings, they tend to give a middle score without any reviews. It does not directly translate into the restaurant's good or bad performance. Reviews represent direct feedback from the customer, which in most businesses is considered a key driver of changes and worth like gold. </p>

## Problem Description:

<p align="justify"> In this project, we want to assess the power of <b>NLP</b> techniques, to retrieve <b>Sentiment Information</b> from text data by using simple <b>Machine Learning Models</b> trained on thoroughly cleaned and prepared data to measure the potential of <b>Predictive Analytics</b> on text data to support restaurants and services businesses to master their feedback loop and make full use of the customer's feedback information.</p>
